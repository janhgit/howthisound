# **A WEBISTE FOR USERS TO SHARE MUSIC AND REVIEW ALBUMS**

*I became tired of spotify not using the potential they have by including a commuinty feature where people could exchange music. So i am making it myself*
**Tech Stack**:

 - Datbase: mongodb
 - Main Frame: Next.Js ( vanilla )
 - Styles : Bootstrap 
 - Authentication: Next-Js(more on that later)
 - Data from Last.fm 


## Auth
The Website is using Next.js's Next-auth to make things simple.
Useres will be able to authenticate via Spotify OR Last.fm OR credentials
Its following the normal OAuth2 flow 
[Check the auth out](https://github.com/janhgit/thissoundgood-/blob/master/pages/api/auth/%5B...nextauth%5D.js)

# TO DOS!

 - Basic Design 
 - Friends System
 - Recomendations
 - Better implementation of Spotify API
 - Quota Extension (spotify API)
